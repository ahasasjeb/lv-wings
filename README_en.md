# Wings

This is a community-maintained fork of the Wings mod.

## ðŸ“œ Project History

- **Original Project**: Created by [pau101](https://github.com/pau101/Wings).
- **1.18.2 Port**: Ported and maintained by [jt789](https://github.com/jt789/WingsPort).

This version of Wings is a community-developed continuation project, originally started by pau101 and later ported to Minecraft 1.18.2 by jt789. When you drink a wings potion, you receive different types of wings with unique attributes.

Compared to earlier versions, this branch adds a "Super Wings" item (obtainable only in Creative mode), stronger potion effects, and an effect that repels hostile mobs within a 14-block diameter. While wearing wings, press R to enter flight. Each type of wing consumes your hunger while flying, taking off, and landing.

There are plans to continue maintaining the project in the future.
